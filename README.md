# JSS-Scripts
 Scripts for Jamf Pro and MacOS
This repository should have all the scripts I use, borrow, or update for use
in Jamf Pro, on MacOS, and on Linux servers. 

Folders and scripts are organized best I can. These are not official Jamf scripts
like there used to be on Jamf Nation, these are my own personal scripts or
modifications to scripts I've found useful. 

Feel free to use this repository as well! Scripts are mostly bash, but I may
also dive into Python scripts as that skill gets improved.
